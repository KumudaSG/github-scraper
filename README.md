Project Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub Topics Scraper project! 
The project uses web scraping to extract information from the GitHub Topics pages. Beautiful Soup is employed to parse the HTML structure of these pages, while the Requests library facilitates fetching the necessary web content. The scraped data includes repository titles, stars, username and repository URL.

This project is developed primarily using the following programming languages and libraries:

Python: The core language for scripting, data manipulation, and analysis.
Beautiful Soup: A powerful library for extracting data from HTML and XML documents.
Requests: A versatile library for making HTTP requests and fetching web content.
Pandas: A data manipulation library that provides flexible data structures and tools for efficient data analysis.

Potential Applications:

Data Analysis and Visualization:
Pandas is utilized to process and clean the collected data, enabling comprehensive analysis. We can present findings through interactive visualizations and informative statistics, revealing trends over time, popular topics, and contributor dynamics. The insights gained from the analysis can aid in making informed decisions about project contributions, technology adoption, and collaborative efforts.
